* functional web development with elixir, otp and phoenix
  - 2017
  - l halvorson
  - phoenix application can maintain persistent channel connections to
    millions of clients, alternative to stateless servers
  - example app is schiffe versenken
  - i think the examples are a bit too detailed and i got bored

* programming phoenix
  - 2019 (2nd rev?)
  - chris mccord, bruce tate
  - phoenix author, perhaps this book is better

  - phoenix provides powerfull guarantees
    - isolation: bug in one channel will not influence others
    - concurrency: channels won't block each other; UI always
      responsive
  - horizontal scaling: broadcast messages across all nodes
  - tracking presence: which users are connected to cluster of
    machines
  - liveview: server-side react
    - page initially like any other static page
    - only changes are transmitted
  - reliability
    - process linking structure allow effective supervision
